## INTRODUCTION[![](./images/pin.svg)](#introduction)
In “Differences in Emoji Sentiment Perception between Readers and Writers”, an experiment was conducted that looked at the emoji sentiment of authors versus
that of writers. Berengueres and Castro found that readers and writers broadly agree on the sentiments of emojis. The largest discrepancy between readers and writers occurs for negative emojis, such as the sad face emoji. We would like to see how emoji sentiment perception differs from country to country [1].
Even though emojis are widely used to provide a reaction through digital communication, it is still better to keep in mind that some meanings of emojis are not universally accepted. The team would like to analyze the sentiment of the top 50 most used emojis in the world.

## HYPOTHESIS[![](./images/pin.svg)](#hypothesis)
In the top 50 most used emojis in the world, at least 50% of them denote more positive feelings than negative feelings, with a sentiment score above 0 on a scale from -1 to 1. Additionally, the correlation between the popularity of emojis and their sentiment scores are greater than 0.5.
